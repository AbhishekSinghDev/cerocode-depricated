## What is Cero?

Cero is a complete ecosystem that brings AI capabilities directly to your terminal—no API keys to manage, no configuration hell—just install and start coding smarter.

Think LLM meets your terminal, but built specifically for developers. Chat with AI, get real-time streaming responses, and keep your entire conversation history synced across devices. All from the comfort of your command line.

## Features

### Currently Available

#### 🤖 AI Chat in Your Terminal

Ask questions, get answers, debug code—all without leaving your terminal. Responses stream in real-time, just like ChatGPT.

```bash
cero chat "explain what DNS is"
```

#### 🎨 Interactive Terminal UI

A proper chat interface in your terminal with:

- Input box at the bottom (like a real chat app)
- Sidebar showing conversation history
- Real-time streaming responses
- Keyboard shortcuts for efficient navigation
- User info display

```bash
cero interactive
```

Think ChatGPT, but native to your terminal.

#### 🔐 Passwordless Authentication

We use OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant (the same flow Netflix uses for TV login). Authenticate once in your browser, never paste API keys into your terminal again.

```bash
cero login
```

#### 💾 Secure Credential Storage

Your access tokens are stored in your OS's native credential manager (Keychain on macOS, Credential Manager on Windows, libsecret on Linux). We never store passwords or API keys in plain text.

#### 📡 Real-Time Streaming

Responses stream token-by-token as they're generated. No waiting for the entire response before seeing anything—you get instant feedback.

#### 🔄 Cross-Platform Support

Works seamlessly on macOS, Windows, and Linux. One codebase, three platforms, zero compromises.

### Coming Soon

We're actively building features that'll make Cero your go-to terminal assistant:

#### 💾 Offline-First History

Your conversations sync both locally and to the cloud:

- Browse chat history without internet connection
- Search through past conversations instantly
- Sync across all your devices
- Never lose important code snippets or solutions

Unlike web apps that need internet just to load, Cero works offline first.

#### 🤖 Agent Mode

Full-blown AI agent capabilities:

- **Context-Aware**: Understands your current project and codebase
- **Iterative Problem Solving**: Works through problems step-by-step
- **Code Exploration**: Navigates your codebase to find relevant context
- **Task Automation**: Executes multi-step workflows

Similar to Copilot's agent or Cursor, but designed for terminal workflows.

#### 📂 Codebase Context

Since Cero runs in your terminal, it has full access to your project:

- Knows what directory you're in
- Can read relevant files for context
- Understands your project structure
- Gives specific answers, not generic ones

#### 🔧 Tool Integration

Planned integrations to supercharge your workflow:

- **Context7** — Up-to-date library documentation
- **Brave Search API** — Real-time web searches
- **URL Inspection** — Fetch and analyze web content
- **Git Integration** — Understand your commit history and branch structure
- **File Operations** — Read, create, and modify files with permission
- **Custom Tools** — Build your own integrations

#### And More...

- Multi-model support (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini)
- Custom prompts and templates
- Team collaboration features
- Usage analytics and insights
- Plugin system for extensibility

## Architecture

Cero is a monorepo containing three main applications:

### 📱 [Cero CLI](apps/cero-cli)

The terminal client that you interact with daily. Built with TypeScript, Commander.js, and OpenTUI for the interactive terminal UI.

**Key Features:**

- Device authorization flow
- Real-time streaming responses

- Secure keychain integration
- Cross-platform support

[View CLI Documentation →](apps/cero-cli/README.md)

### 🌐 [Cero Web](apps/cero-web)

The web companion that handles authentication and provides a landing page for the project. Built with Next.js 16, Tailwind CSS v4, and Radix UI.

**Key Features:**

- Device authorization approval UI
- GitHub OAuth integration
- Project documentation
- Responsive design with dark mode

[View Web Documentation →](apps/cero-web/README.md)

### ⚡ [Cero API](apps/cero-api)

The backend powering everything. Built with Next.js 16 as a full-stack API server, using Better Auth, Drizzle ORM, and Inngest for background jobs.

**Key Features:**

- OAuth 2.0 device flow
- AI chat with streaming responses
- Background job processing
- Conversation persistence

## How It Works

### Authentication Flow

1. User runs `cero login` in terminal
2. CLI requests device code from API
3. API generates code and returns verification URL
4. User opens URL in browser and enters code
5. CLI polls API for token approval
6. On approval, API returns access token
7. CLI stores token in OS keychain
8. Future requests use this token automatically

### Chat Flow

1. User sends message via `cero chat "message"` or interactive mode
2. CLI sends authenticated request to API
3. API triggers Inngest background job
4. Job streams AI response via Inngest Realtime channels
5. CLI receives tokens as Server-Sent Events
6. Tokens are rendered in real-time

### Data Storage

- **Tokens**: OS native keychain (Keychain, Credential Manager, libsecret)
- **User Data**: Neon Postgres via Drizzle ORM
- **Sessions**: Better Auth with 7-day expiry
- **Conversations**: Postgres with user association
